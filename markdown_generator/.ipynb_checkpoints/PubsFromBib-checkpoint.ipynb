    "   Abstract={Long-term storage of episodic memories is hypothesized to result from the off-line transfer of information from the hippocampus to neocortex, allowing a hippocampal-independent cortical representation to emerge. However, off-line hippocampal-cortical interactions have not been demonstrated to be linked with long-term memory. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined if hippocampal-cortical BOLD correlations during rest following an associative encoding task are related to later associative memory performance. Our data show enhanced functional connectivity between the hippocampus and a portion of the lateral occipital complex (LO) during rest following a task with high subsequent memory compared to pretask baseline resting connectivity. This effect is not seen during rest following a task with poor subsequent memory. Furthermore, the magnitude of hippocampal-LO correlations during posttask rest predicts individual differences in later associative memory. These results demonstrate the importance of postexperience resting brain correlations for memory for recent experiences.}\n",

    "   Abstract={Different items in long-term knowledge are stored in the neocortex as partially overlapping representations that can be altered slightly with usage. This encoding scheme affords well-documented benefits, but potential costs have not been well explored. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neurocomputational modeling, and electrophysiological measures to show that strengthening some visual object representations not only enhances the subsequent ability to identify those (repeated) objects-an effect long known as repetition priming-but also impairs the ability to identify other (non-repeated) objects-a new effect labeled antipriming. As a result, the non-repeated objects elicit increased neural activity likely for the purpose of reestablishing their previously weakened representations. These results suggest a novel reevaluation of the ubiquitously observed repetition effect on neural activity, and they indicate that maintenance relearning may be a crucial aspect of preserving overlapping neural representations of visual objects in long-term memory.}\n",

Specifically, two pathways, Tri-Synaptic and Mono-Synaptic, alternate in strength during theta oscillations to provide an alternation of encoding vs. recall bias in area CA1. The difference between these two states and the unaltered cortical input representation creates an error signal, which can drive powerful error-driven learning in both Tri-Synaptic and Mono-Synaptic pathways. Furthermore, the presence of these alternating modes of network behavior (encoding vs. recall) provide an intriguing target for future work examining how prefrontal control mechanisms can manipulate the behavior of the hippocampus.</p>},\n",
