I am a research scientist at [HRL laboratories](http://www.hrl.com/) in the [Center for Human Machine Collaboration](http://chmc.hrl.com/) where I'm investigating various aspects of learning and memory. Recently I graduated from the Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at the University Colorado Boulder with [Randy O'Reilly](https://ccnlab.org/people/oreilly/). Before that I did my undergraduate at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis where I studied Physics, and got involved in computational modeling with [Chad Marsolek](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/marso002). I then spent a few years at New York University with [Lila Davachi](https://davachilab.psychology.columbia.edu/) using fMRI to explore the neurobiology of episodic memory. Right now I'm mostly taking all this cognitive neuroscience experience and extending it to modern methods in artificial intelligence research, namely developing machine learning methods and architectures to support neural mechanisms similar to those seen in human learning and memory.

## Research Interests
In general I've been working to understand different learning and memory systems and how they can be related to underlying neurobiology. In particular, I'm interested in how the brain encodes new information, how its able to both index and retrieve that information and exert control over these processes in a willful way. Similarly, how learned information can be actively pruned, compressed, and consolidated over time in various neural architectures (both in-vivo and in-silico).  This involves several sub-domains of psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science including memory, semantics, perception, cognitive control, decision making and reinforcement learning.

I try to use data collected from human participants to inform computer simulations of the neural systems that support the empirically observed behaviors. This includes data collected from behavior in various psychological tasks, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and Electroencephalography (EEG). The models I use to simulate these measures are generally neural networks constrained by the known architecture of biological systems, but more recently have incorporated modern approaches or 'deep learning' as well.

Recently I've been applying my learning and memory experience within the domain of lifelong machine learning.  Here autonomous systems are expected to continue to accumulate knowledge beyond a single dataset or task.  My work focuses on using neural network models to generate samples of previous experiences to preserve a reinforcement learning system's performance while also allowing it to continue to learn new tasks.
